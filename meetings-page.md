## Looking for help?

If you believe you have a problem with sex addiction (or are wondering if you might) and you want to change your behavior, we recommend that you find and attend a meeting of Sex Addicts Anonymous as soon as possible. We have found that the path to recovery begins with meetings. You may attend as many meetings as you like, and they are free of charge. 
The only requirement is a desire to stop your addictive sexual behavior. [You may find a list of meetings here.](https://www.saa-recovery.org/Meetings "Meetings")	We wish you well in your recovery
